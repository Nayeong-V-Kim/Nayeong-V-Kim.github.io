I am a second-year PhD student in computer science and engineering department at POSTECH.
I am a member of [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr) at POSTECH and advised by [Jaesik Park](https://jaesik.info).

My research interests lie in the intersection of 3D computer vision and deep learning.
I've worked on the correspondence estimation for images and point clouds, efficient 3D perception network architectures, neural rendering and implicit representation.
I've received M.S. at POSTECH during which I conducted researches on the image matching and point cloud registration.
