# My research interests lie in the intersection of 3D computer vision and deep learning.
# I've worked on the correspondence estimation for images and point clouds, efficient 3D perception network architectures, neural rendering and implicit representation.
# I've received M.S. at POSTECH during which I conducted researches on the image matching and point cloud registration.

I am a Ph.D student in computer science and engineering department at [POSTECH](http://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/), advised by [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io/).
My research intersets is developing algorithms which mitigate spurious correlations in real-world datasets.
I am a member of [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr) at POSTECH. Previously, I received a BA in computer science and engineering department from POSTECH in 2017.
